Typical website pattern:
Database --> Server --> Webpage

MVC pattern:
Data Layer (Database) --> Model Layer --> Controller Layer --> View Layer

MVC pattern with additional abstraction layer for data access:
Data Layer (Database) --> Data Access Layer --> Model Layer --> Controller Layer --> View Layer

Constructors are methods of a class that are called whenever a new instance (object) of that class is created.

The ViewBag is an object accessible within controller classes that can define dynamic properties which are then passed to the view.

Ternaray operator follows the if else pattern:

int num = 5;

if (num == 5)
{
	num++;
}
else 
{
	num--;
}

is equivalent to

num == 5 ? num++ : num--;
