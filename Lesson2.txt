Inheritance allows a derived class to inherit all non-private members from a base class.
A derived class can only inherit from a single base class.
Inheritance is also multi-level in the sense that a derived class can inherit from a base class that inherits from another base class.

Interfaces allow methods to be defined without implementation, which must then be implemented by the derived class.
A class may implement multiple interfaces.

All collections implement the IEnumerable interface.
Lists implement other interfaces on top of IEnumerable that allow for add and delete operations which manipulate the collection size.
Lists are read into memory as an entire collection at once and its elements can be accessed via indexing.
Enumerables are read into memory one item at a time, have a fixed size and its elements cannot be accessed via indexing.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protcol) is a protocol or set of rules that must be followed when a browser sends a request to a server.
HTTP GET - Indicates that this is a request to fetch data from the server.
HTTP POST - Indicates that this is a request that posts data to the server.
Other HTTP request types include PUT, PATCH and DELETE.
Most web applications follow the CRUD pattern which implies that they perform the create, read, update and delete operations. 

The static modifier prefixed to a variable implies that it will only be initialized once throughout our entire system and its value will persist in-memory.
This modifier can also be applied to methods, classes and various other C# strucures.
